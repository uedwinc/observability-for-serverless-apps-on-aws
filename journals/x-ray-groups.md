# Troubleshooting performance issues using X-Ray groups

It would be practically difficult to analyze all the X-Ray traces generated by a complex system and look at each trace to understand the issues. That’s where X-Ray groups will be helpful. X-Ray groups will help simplify the process by focusing on the filtered traces based on rule-based criteria when there is a breach in a specific parameter. For example, if you would like to focus on the traces where the response time is greater than 2 seconds, you can create an X-Ray group with the criteria of `responseTime > 2`. This way, you can quickly isolate and analyze only the traces that indicate a problem, making it easier to identify and resolve issues.

Let’s create an X-Ray group and understand only the problematic traces from the generated traces:

1. You can see from the following figure that there are lots of traces with different response times. You can filter and focus only on the traces with a response time greater than (>) 2 seconds.

2. Now, let’s create an X-Ray group by navigating to `CloudWatch` | `Settings` | `Traces` | `Groups` | `View settings`:

3. Click `Create group`, name the group as `LatencyGreaterthan2s`, and set Filter expression to `responseTime > 2`.

4. Navigate to `Traces` | `Filter by X-Ray group` | `LatencyGreaterthan2s`.

5. You should see only traces greater than 2 seconds, as the other traces are filtered out due to the X-Ray group.

6. You can also repeat the same process to filter the traces based on annotations. In this example, we have annotated `ColdStart` in Lambda functions. You can create the filter using annotation as follows:

```
annotation.ColdStart = true
```

You could write a filter expression to focus on only the traces when the AWS Lambda is having a cold start and observe the pattern of those traces exclusively for any other issues

X-Ray groups will be fundamentally helpful to filter out traces based on metrics and annotations and focus on only the problem traces to get a clearer understanding of the issues at hand. This will help you focus on traces that may have a potential impact on your application rather than focusing on every trace.
