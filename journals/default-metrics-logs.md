# Exploring default metrics and logs

Let’s look at the default out-of-the-box metrics and logs available when you deploy an application on AWS Lambda.

## Built-in metrics

Lambda comes with 15 default metrics (please visit https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/monitoring-metrics.html for more information) divided into three categories: `Invocation metrics`, `Performance metrics`, and `Concurrency metrics`.

Some of the important Lambda metrics are `Invocations`, `Errors`, `Throttles`, `Duration`, and `ConcurrentExecutions`. You can create a widget with the important metrics as shown here:

To fully understand the performance of Lambda functions, it is crucial to track the `duration of the execution` and `percentile of requests completed within a period` to analyze the performance impact.

Analyzing the P90 metric (the P90 metric provides you with the average duration of execution of less than or equal to 90% of requests executed for a given period), reveals that 50% of requests are processed within 54.8 ms (milliseconds), 90% within 379 ms, and 95% within 383 ms.

These statistics provide valuable insights and can guide you toward optimizing the function’s configuration for improved performance.

Now that we have explored the default metrics generated by AWS Lambda in CloudWatch, let’s explore the default logging being provided in AWS Lambda when the out-of-the-box logging feature is enabled.

## Lambda logging

When you deploy a Lambda function, logging is enabled by default. It provide logs for every execution with information about billed duration, memory use, and memory configured.

To verify the logs generated due to Lambda invocation, you can navigate to `CloudWatch` | `Logs` | `Log groups` and verify the log group name starting with `/aws/lambda/serverless-app-getAllItemsFunction-%%%%`. The last few characters are randomly generated. You can select the log stream to view the logs generated by the Lambda function.
